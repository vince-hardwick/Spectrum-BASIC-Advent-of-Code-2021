# Spectrum-BASIC-Advent-of-Code-2021

https://adventofcode.com/2021/about

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

====================================

I'll be attempting these challenges using the Spectaculator 8.0 emulator for the ZX Spectrum, confiugured to use the 128K model, but without using Z80 machine code. Sinclair BASIC only.

I must be completely insane. But here goes.

If you want to load the .tap files and try out my solutions, here's where you can download the emulator (you'll get a free trial period, 28 days I think):
